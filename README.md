## **CONTACTLESS CARD DOOR CONTROL AUTOMATION PROJECT**

### Purpose of the Project :

Ensuring access control to work environments and preventing unnecessary entries by controlling the doors of work areas in any common area (corridor, etc.) from a central point with the contactless card (RFID Tag) given to each user.
Ensuring that entries and exits are made only with the permission of defined users.
